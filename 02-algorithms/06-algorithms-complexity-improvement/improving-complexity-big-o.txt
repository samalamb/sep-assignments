1. improving_complexity_version_one: Improve the code
  - This one is the most simple one. I simplified the function by doing a flatten instead of the long loop.
  Next I made the for loop a .each loop like in the example in the checkpoint.

2. improving_complexity_version_two
  - This one is about saving time, so I used a built in hash since you can find any value in a hash without having to know it's index.

3. improving_complexity_version_three
  - This one is about saving space so I used built in ruby functions and only used them on the original array no other arrays needed.
  Still using flatten to make the time quicker as well.
  Side note when copy and pasting the code for the checkpoint assignment it doesn't properly combine the arrays.
