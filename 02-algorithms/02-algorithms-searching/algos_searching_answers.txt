1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
  - It would take 7 iterations to find the letter 'G' as it's the 7th letter of
  the alphabet.
2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
  - It would take 3 iterations to find using binary search
3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
  Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
  - fib(10): fib(8) + fib(9)
              21    +   34   =   55
  - fib(12): fib(10) + fib(11)
              55     +   89  =   144
