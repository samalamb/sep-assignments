enqueue: For this one I did some googling for the Array functions that I had at my disposal.
I found that there was a great function called unshift that did exactly what I wanted
to do which was create a new element in the [0] position of an array.

dequeue: This one was pretty simple I remember dealing with the delete_at function
in Ruby before and all I needed to do was delete it at the first element of the array.

empty?: Simple a one line if/ else statement checking the length of the array if it
is equal to 0 then it would return true and false if not.
