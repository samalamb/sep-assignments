push: This function was the simple one. I just made a new item at the end of the
array that was already created, and then set the self.top to equal the new value
at the end of the Array

pop: This was the harder function, but mainly because I was having a hard time
trying to figure out what the order I was supposed to put all the functions and
variables in. This was actually the last function that I wrote before all the
tests passed. The rest of them were finished well before.

empty?: Same as the last empty? function; I used a comparison to check whether or
not the array length was 0 or not.
